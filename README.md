\#lang clojure
=============

This project is a stub for a Clojure compatibility language in Racket.

Its primary purpose is to let me practice writing macros and using
Racket's language extensions tools. If you are interested in making this
usable for real purposes, feel free to send me pull requests.

To install on Racket 5.3.4 and newer:

  * `git clone git://github.com/takikawa/racket-clojure.git`
  * `raco pkg install racket-clojure/`

On older versions of Racket:

  * `git clone git://github.com/takikawa/racket-clojure.git`
  * `raco link racket-clojure`
  * `raco setup clojure`
